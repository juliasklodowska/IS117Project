    <h6><strong>Founders</strong></h6>
    <p>Richard Butler founded Butler and a man named  William Kiel became the first mayor.</p>
    <h6><strong>How was Butler Founded?</strong></h6>
    <p>Richard Butler, a businessman from New York traveled to what was known as West Bloomingdale at the time and bought an existing rubber factory. In 1879, he became the president of the Rubber Comb and Jewelry Company, which was later known as the Butler Hard Rubber Company. In 1881, a post office was named "Butler" to honor Richard Butler, since his improvements to the Rubber Mill caused the town to be popular. Later on, William Kiel was asked by Richard Butler to come from Europe to be the superintendent of the hard rubber company. He then became the first mayor and donated money to make the borough park.</p>
    <h6><strong>What Made Butler Popular?</strong></h6>
    <p>Butler’s rubber mill and industry popularized it. It drew in hundreds of workers back in the day, and many of them decided to live and vacation to Butler. Roads were laid out, and homes, stores, and hotels were made. Schools were also later built, as well as churches.</p>
