    <p>I believe that Butler NJ is a great little town. Although it is not really known or important to a lot of people, it isn’t bad in any way from my experience. We have a police department very close to us, making it safe, as well as a fire department within walking distance of the police department and other homes. There are a lot of places for kids to have fun, including playgrounds and parks. I never get bored of anything and food places are very close to my home. Everything is super close since it is a small town. As for the school system, it isn’t perfect, but there are lots of resources that will help you get a good education. I’ve never had an issue with the school system, and I actually came out of it with a lot of knowledge. There may not be a lot of classes available in the school, but from the classes that I took, I learned a lot. Also, you could just take classes that aren’t offered here, in college later on in life, or even go to a different high school like Morris County Tech, which isn’t that far. That is what a lot of my classmates did, and they still live in Butler. They just go to a different school. There are also fun events I have been a part of, such as the park lighting, where in the beginning of December the town comes together to light up the park. There’s also plenty of community service we do, and overall this town is great if you want to be in a calm area.</p>
